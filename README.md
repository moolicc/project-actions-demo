This repo is to be used as a demonstration for Actions and Projects

# Projects
This repo will demonstrate the use of Github Projects for Agile teams.

# To setup for your own repo
For a user repo, setup should be relatively easy.
Just edit the .github/workflows/conf.json appropriately, keeping in mind that values are case sensitive.

For an organization repo, some tweaking to the workflow itself will be required.

This app now supports copy and pasting text.
